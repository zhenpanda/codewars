// Introduction
//  Little Petya very much likes sequences. Recently he has received one as a gift from his mother.
//  Petya didn't like it at once. He decided to make a replacement. After the replacement Petya sorted the sequence by the numbers' non-decreasing.
//  Now he is asking himself: What is the minimal possible value I could have got after the replacement and sorting the sequence?

// About the replacement
//  Choose exactly one element from the sequence and replace it with another integer > 0. It is not allowed to replace a number with itself or to change no number at all.

// Task
//  Find the minimal possible sequence after performing a valid replacement and sorting the sequence.

// Input:
//  Input contains sequence with N integers. All elements of the sequence > 0. The sequenc will never be empty.

// Output:
//  Return sequence with N integers — the minimum possible values of each sequence element after one replacement and the sorting are performed.

// Examples:

// ([1,2,3,4,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
// ([4,2,1,3,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
// ([2,3,4,5,6])  =>  [1,2,3,4,5]
// ([2,2,2])      =>  [1,2,2]
// ([42])         =>  [1]
